# SQLProject
The expansion of supermarkets in densely populated cities is accelerating, leading to heightened market competition. This dataset represents historical sales records from a supermarket chain, capturing transactions from three different branches over a three-month period. Its structured nature makes it well-suited for applying predictive data analytics techniques.

# Overview
In the highly competitive retail landscape, supermarkets must leverage data-driven insights to optimize sales strategies, manage inventory efficiently, and enhance customer experience. This project explores supermarket sales data from multiple branches over a defined period, aiming to uncover key purchasing trends, peak sales periods, and high-performing product categories.
By applying SQL for in-depth data analysis and Tableau for visual storytelling, this project transforms raw sales data into actionable insights. Understanding customer behavior, preferred payment methods, and seasonal fluctuations enables businesses to make strategic decisions that drive revenue growth and improve operational efficiency.
This analysis demonstrates how business intelligence and data analytics can empower retailers to stay competitive, predict future trends, and tailor marketing efforts to maximize profitability.
The project involves:

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning: Preparing and transforming raw sales data for analysis.
2. SQL-Based Analysis: Extracting insights on top-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer spending habits through filtering, aggregation, and trend analysis.
3. Data Visualization: Using Tableau to create interactive charts highlighting seasonal trends, category performance, and revenue patterns.
4. Business Insights & Recommendations: Providing data-driven strategies to optimize inventory management, promotions, and customer engagement.
